# Code Bucket

Just a dumping area for some random code that pops into my brain.


## Sequences

Doing some work on allowing unbounded (but countable) sequences to be handled
similarly to other Enumerable collections in Ruby.  I've attempted several
different approaches found in:

* infinite_enumeration.rb (and generators.rb)
* infseq.rb
* numfilter.rb

So far, numfilter.rb is my favored implementation.
